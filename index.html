Hello World

July 9, 2017
Finally, I'm going to start work in my dream company tomorrow! I've been both excited and nervous. It is such a high tech company that 
probably most of electrical engineers who fancy chip design would want to be part of it, so I'm very proud that I can do something I like
in a company who plays a very important roal in this industry. On the other hand, I'm afraid that my knowledge will not be enough for my
position, or what my team will be expecting me. But I know there will always be challanges in life, conquer them and you make progresses.
That's how you grow up and grow stranger, and you are capable of doing further things you want to do. In this case, I think I'm more excited
about tomorrow:). Meeting new people, start a new and different chapter in my life. Yes it is about adulthood, haha.
Talking about being an adult, ah, what should I say. I feel that I have the ability to be calm and confident in front of people, but sometimes
I'm so shy that I'd rather stay in a corner by myself and stay away from all the crowds. I try to forbid myself doing the second one,
because if I do so, I'll just keep doing it, which is definatelly not healty in a social environment, lol. But don't get me wrong, I like
being with people and talking to people, I like to have a company. It's just everything needs efforts to make it into a right direction. I'm
trying to make myself suit the society, but at the same time I want to respect my feelings and express them. That's what I think a humanbings
should do -- follow your heart and follow the rules. Well it's definatelly not easy.
