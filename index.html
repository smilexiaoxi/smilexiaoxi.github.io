Hello World

July 9, 2017
Finally, I'm going to start work in my dream company tomorrow! I've been both excited and nervous. It is such a high tech company that 
probably most of electrical engineers who fancy chip design would want to be part of it, so I'm very proud that I can do something I like
in a company who plays a very important roal in this industry. On the other hand, I'm afraid that my knowledge will not be enough for my
position, or what my team will be expecting me. But I know there will always be challanges in life, conquer them and you make progresses.
That's how you grow up and grow stranger, and you are capable of doing further things you want to do. In this case, I think I'm more excited
about tomorrow:). Meeting new people, start a new and different chapter of my life. Yes it is about adulthood, haha.
Talking about being an adult, ah, what should I say. I feel that I have the ability to be calm and confident in front of people, but sometimes
I'm so shy that I'd rather stay in a corner by myself and stay away from all the crowds. I try to forbid myself doing the second one,
because if I do so, I'll just keep doing it, which is definatelly not healty in a social environment, lol. But don't get me wrong, I like
being with people and talking to people, I like to have a company. It's just everything needs efforts to make it into a right direction and
you can't be lazy. I'm trying to make myself suit the society, but at the same time I want to respect my feelings and express them. That's
what I think a human bings should do -- follow your heart and follow the rules. Well it's definatelly not easy.
I probably should go sleep early, like now. For the new begining tomorrow, wish me good luck!
PS. Last two nights I could hear the floor above me so clearly! Like how many times. I know things after all. I wish they can change a bed
or something.

I might have lost myself. No not that bad but I did something that against the myself-before. I know people change, but I didn't think you are
changing in a way that you can't a hundred percent control it. It's scary because you don't know what to do but you have to live with it. It
is not easy to make friends, even though I want to and I try to. I'm having the similar feeling with when I just came to America, the time
I don't have a friend who knows me well and can talk to me, because they were all in China. Now, they are in New York. Yes, you finally made
some friends, you both have experienced getting used to trust and being trust by each other, and finally you guys can talk without warriness.
Then the geographical distance. Now, I need to start everything over again. The difference this time might be that I haven't cried yet, haha.
I used to think that being alone is a way to make I grow up and make me bing stronger. Because of being alone, I have to think all things
through myself. I have to admitted that it's painful and I don't like it. But that's the way you live, and maybe that's the way most people
are living with. You are not that special afterall.
Anyway, I still need to find the way, to do those things, to live the life. Even though it won't be the easy way. I still consider myself
optimistic, though it seems conflictive.
Recently I'm very sleepy during the day so I should have slept more at night, but I just don't want to just go to bed.
